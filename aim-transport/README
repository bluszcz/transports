Features
--------

- reliable messaging (via server only)
- simple user info retrieval (ICQ only)
  may take some time, just wait...
- SMS sending (ICQ)
  send "SEND-SMS:number:text" to any ICQ user, for example
  "SEND-SMS:+4917012345:Test"
- away message retrieval (AIM only)
- offline messages (ICQ only)

- NO file transfer
- NO multichat
- NO user search
- NO incoming SMS
- NO import of server buddy lists
- NO handling of incoming ICQ auth requests
  hint: disable "auth req'd" - it is insecure anyway


Installation
------------

This version of AIM-t is a module for Jabberd 1.4.x. While it can connect
to any Jabber server that supports the connect/accept mechanism, it can
only be run in a 1.4.x binary.

To build AIM-t uncompress the tarball. If you uncompressed it into the
Jabber directory you can run the configure directly and it will find the
jabberd 1.4.x sources needed to compile. Otherwise, you need to use the
--with-jabberd=PATH option to configure. At this point you can run make
and it should build just fine.


1. Main Jabber server configuration files

In order to have your main Jabber server accept connections from AIM-t,
you have to configure it accordingly.

For jabberd server, add the following to the <service> section of its
configuration file.

 <service id="aim">
   <host>aim.localhost</host>
   <accept>
     <ip>127.0.0.1</ip>
     <port>5555</port>
     <secret>someSecret</secret>
     <timeout>30</timeout>
   </accept>
 </service>

Be sure to replace "localhost" with the full host name of your server
if you want users of other Jabber servers to be able to use this
transport. Also, the host name of the transport has to be resolveable
via DNS then.

In order to advertise the transport's services to the Jabber clients, add
the following to the <browse> section of the main jabberd configuration
file.

 <service type="aim" jid="aim.localhost" name="AIM Link">
   <ns>jabber:iq:gateway</ns>
   <ns>jabber:iq:register</ns>
 </service>


2. AIM module configuration files

An example configuration file is included (aim.xml), modify it as needed.


If you want to set up a separate transport for ICQ, just duplicate all
sections mentioned above and replace "aim" by "icq". Be sure to change
the connect/accept ports for the second transport instance of course.


Running
-------

Be sure to have the main Jabber server running, then

 jabberd/jabberd -c aim-transport/aim.xml

Repeat this for the second AIM-t advertised as ICQ-t if needed.

If you run into trouble, add "-D" for debug output.


Notes
-----

- Firewalls
AIM-t currently only uses an outgoing TCP connection per session. So no
incoming ports need to be opened.

- Dropped Messages
ICQ messages may get dropped by AOL servers if your contact uses an old
ICQv5 client. This is not AIM-t's fault. Your contact should upgrade or
switch to Jabber ;-).


Bugs
----

If you experience crashes, please include a backtrace in your bug report
(see AIM-t's website). You get a backtrace by using gdb ("gdb -c core
jabberd/jabberd", "bt" command within gdb). To enable core dump files
use "ulimit -c unlimited" (bash).
