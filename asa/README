ApaSMSAgent - Jabber server component agent for sending
SMS messages to cellular networks. Targetted at polish users,
but can be adopted for international use, because of it's
plugin-based architecture.

HowTo:

vim config.xml
./ApaSMSAgent.pl

Tweaking:

WwwPlusa plugin might need to be tweaked a little - it uses
hardcoded anonymous proxy list to connect to the service website.
The list evolves, and should be modified by hand if there are
too many proxy errors reported. A nice list of proxies is located
at http://www.atomintersoft.com/products/alive-proxy/proxy-list/

Important:

Don't forget to track http://forum.jabberpl.org for information
on important updates to this software! I take no responsibility
if your users cry because of an old agent;) 

Users guide:

Kolargol wrote a nice guide for ApaSMSAgent, located at
http://jabber.autocom.pl/sms.php (in Polish, po polsku).

Limitations:

It's a perl application, so it eats CPU and RAM quite a bit.
Kolargol reported problems with users above 500 or so. See TODO
file to look-up the solution. Yes, it needs to be rewritten in
Python.
