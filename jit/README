Introduction
------------

JIT consists of WPJabber (which in fact is a modified
Jabberd 1.4, see wpjabber.jabberstudio.org) and an ICQ
transport module for this server.

JIT (or precisely spoken, WPJabber + ICQ module) links
to the main Jabber server via the connect/accept
mechanism. This means you can use JIT with every Jabber
server implementation (be it jabberd 1.4, WPJabber or a
commercial server) that can accept TCP connections from
external components.

For installation instructions see jit/INSTALL


Jabberd/WPJabber features
-------------------------

 - uses pthreads instead of pth
 - supports multi-processor systems
 - fast and stable
 - architecture compatible with jabberd 1.4.2
   (so it is easy to rewrite existing modules)


ICQ transport features
----------------------

 - threads architecture
 - jit uses libicq2000 
 - messages, presences and sms support
 - search support
 - vcard support
