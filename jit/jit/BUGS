1. JIT does not show ICQ contacts online

JIT uses the user's Jabber roster for getting contacts list.
You can always use <own_roster/> flag in config file to make JIT
storing contacts list.

2. WebPresence doesn't work.

Check configuration file for <web/> tag. If you don't have <web/>, add one
and web presence will start working.
