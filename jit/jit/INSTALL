============================

Building WPJabber and ICQ module
--------------------------------

Go to main directory and
 ./configure
 make

You should have a
 jabberd/jabberd
executable (WPJabber) and
 jit/jit.so
then (ICQ module for WPJabber).


Configuration
-------------

1. Main Jabber server configuration files

In order to have your main Jabber server accept connections from JIT,
you have to configure it accordingly.

For jabberd server, add the following to the <service> section of its
configuration file.

 <service id="icq">
   <host>icq.localhost</host>
   <host>sms.icq.localhost</host>
   <accept>
     <ip>127.0.0.1</ip>
     <port>5555</port>
     <secret>someSecret</secret>
     <timeout>30</timeout>
   </accept>
 </service>

Be sure to replace "localhost" with the full host name of your server
if you want users of other Jabber servers to be able to use this
transport. Also, the host name of the transport has to be resolveable
via DNS then.

In order to advertise the ICQ transport's services to the Jabber
clients, add the following to the <browse> section of the main jabberd
configuration file.

 <service type="icq" jid="icq.localhost" name="ICQ Link">
   <ns>jabber:iq:gateway</ns>
   <ns>jabber:iq:register</ns>
   <ns>jabber:iq:search</ns>
 </service>


2. ICQ module configuration files

An example configuration file is included, modify it as needed.


Running
-------

chdir to the main directory of the tarball

 jabberd/jabberd -c jit/jabber-icq.xml

If you run into trouble, add "-D" for debug output.


Notes
-----

- Auto-Import						    
If you want the auto-import function that imports ICQ
server-side contact lists to import the nicks too, you
have to patch your Jabber server, see
http://jit.jabberstudio.org/mod_roster.c.diff

- Firewalls
JIT only creates outgoing connections to port 5190 of
the ICQ servers currently.
