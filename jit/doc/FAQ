JIT - Jabber ICQ Transport FAQ


==================================================================
1. Why JIT ?

 - JIT starts only small amount of threads ( 12 ) for all connected users
 - JIT is stable and very fast
 - JIT supports most functions that user would need
 
 
2. Why in my messages chars looks ugly or were converted to '?'
 - Try using another charset, for example iso-8859-1 in config file


3. Auto-import of the ICQ contact lists does not import the contact's nick
 - The Jabber server needs to be patched for this to work, see
