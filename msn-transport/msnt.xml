		If the user did enter a nickname on registration, but they have a blank status message, then their friendly name will just be the registered nickname

		If the above chosen friendly name is too long, then it will be truncated and "..." placed at the end. MSN only supports friendly names of 128 characters, so this is unavoidable.
		
		If this is disabled, then the registered nick is always sent as the MSN friendly name, or if that is blank, the username portion of their JID is sent instead
